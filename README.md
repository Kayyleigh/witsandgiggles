# WitsAndGiggles (may become KicksAndRiddles or WitsAndRiddles)

WitsAndGiggles is a puzzle-sharing web application. It allows users to register an account with a unique username,
and create puzzles such as Sudokus that will appear on their profile. Other users can find these
puzzles and interact with them, such as solving the puzzle or leaving comments. The system is aware of the
internal workings of the puzzle: it knows the ruleset of the puzzle, and can warn puzzle creators when they
make a mistake, or try to publish an invalid puzzle.

The system uses spring security and JWT tokens. For this I followed a tutorial by Amigoscode on YouTube:
